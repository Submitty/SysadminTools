# Nightly Database Backup Python Script
Readme June 26, 2018

### db_backup.py

This script will read a course list, corresponding to a specific term, from
the 'master' Submitty database.  With a course list, the script will use
Postgresql's "pg_dump" tool to retrieve a SQL dump of the submitty 'master'
database and each registered course's Submitty database of a specific semester.
The script also has cleanup functionality to automatically remove older dumps.

*db_backup.py is written in Python 3, and tested with Python 3.4.*

---

The term code can be specified as a command line argument as option `-t`.

For example:

`python3 ./db_backup.py -t f17`

will dump the submitty 'master' database and all courses registered with term
code `f17` (Fall 2017).  This option is useful to dump course databases of
previous term, or to dump course databases that have a non-standard term code.

Alternatively, the `-g` option will have the term code guessed by using the
current month and year of the server's date.

The term code will follow the pattern of TYY, where
- T is the term
  - **s** is for Spring (Jan - May)
  - **u** is for Summer (Jun - Jul)
  - **f** is for Fall (Aug-Dec)
- YY is the two digit year
- e.g. April 15, 2018 will correspond to "s18" (Spring 2018).

`-t` and `-g` are mutually exclusive.

---

Each dump has a date stamp in its name following the format of "YYMMD",
followed by the semester code, then the course code.

e.g. '180423_s18_cs100.dbdump' is a dump taken on April 23, 2018 of the Spring
2018 semester for course CS-100.

Older dumps can be automatically purged with the command line option "-e".

For example:

`python3 ./db_backup.py -t f17 -e 7`

will purge any dumps with a stamp seven days or older.  Only dumps of the
term being processed will be purged, in this example, 'f17'.

The default expiration value is 0 (no expiration -- no files are purged) should
this argument be ommitted.

---

Submitty databases can be restored from a dump using the pg_restore tool.
q.v. [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/app-pgrestore.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/app-pgrestore.html)

This is script intended to be run as a cronjob by 'root' on the same server
machine as the Submitty system.  *Running this script on another server other
than Submitty has not been tested.*

---

Please configure options near the top of the code.

DB_HOST: Hostname of the Submitty databases.  You may use 'localhost' if
Postgresql is on the same machine as the Submitty system.

DB_USER: The username that interacts with Submitty databases.  Typically
'hsdbu'.

DB_PASS: The password for Submitty's database account (e.g. account 'hsdbu').
**Do NOT use the placeholder value of 'DB.p4ssw0rd'**

DUMP_PATH: The folder path to store the database dumps.  Course folders will
be created from this path, and the dumps stored in their respective course
folders, grouped by semester.

and practices.

db_backup.py is tested to run on Python 3.4 or higher.

NOTE: Some modification of code may be necessary to work with your school's
information systems.
