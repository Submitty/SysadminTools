//
//IMPORTANT: Consult with your University's IT administrator and/or registrar to
//           add all pertinant student-is-registered codes that can be found in
//           your CSV data dump.  EXAMPLE: 'RA' may mean "registered by advisor"

// The following constants are used to read the CSV auto feed file provided by
// the registrar / data warehouse.  ***THESE NEED TO BE SET.
//
// CSV_AUTH can be set to 'local' or 'remote_password' or 'remote_keypair'.
//
//          'local' means the CSV file can be read locally by the script, so no
//          remote authentication details are needed.
//
//          'remote_password' means that the file must be accessed on another
//           server, and authentication is by password.
//           q.v. CSV_AUTH_PASSWORD
//
//           'remote_key' means that the file must be accessed on another
//           server, and authentication is by RSA key pair.
//           q.v. CSV_AUTH_PUBKEY, CSV_AUTH_PRIVKEY, CSV_PRIVKEY_PASSPHRASE
//
// CSV_FILE is the full path of the student auto feed file, regardless if it is
//          accessed locally or remotely.
//
// CSV_REMOTE_SERVER is the fully qualified domain name of the server that hosts
//                   the student feed CSV file.  This constant is ignored when
//                   CSV_AUTH is set to 'local'.
//
// CSV_AUTH_USER is the user account to access the student feed CSV, when the
//               file exists on a remote server.  This constant is ignored when
//               CSV_AUTH is set to 'local'.
//
// CSV_AUTH_PASSWORD is the user account password required to access the student
//                   feed CSV on a remote server.  This constant is ignored when
//                   CSV_AUTH is set to anything other than 'remote_password'.
//
// CSV_AUTH_PUBKEY is the path to the public key used to authenticate with the
//                 remote server that has the student feed CSV.  The public key
//                 needs to be in OpenSSH format.  This constant is ignored
//                 when CSV_AUTH is set to anything other than 'remote_keypair'.
//
// CSV_AUTH_PRIVKEY is the path to the private key used to communicate with the
//                  remote server that has the student feed CSV.  This constant
//                  is ignored when CSV_AUTH is set to anything other than
//                  'remote_keypair'.
//
// CSV_PRIVKEY_PASSPHRASE is the passphrase used to encrypt the private key.
//                        Set to null, if the private key is not encrypted.
//                        This constant is ignored when CSV_AUTH is set to
//                        anything other than 'remote_keypair'.
//                        NOTE: To use encrypted keys with an Ubuntu SSH/SFTP
//                              host, libssh2 needs be manually recompiled with
//                              OpenSSH.  Otherwise, authentication will always
//                              fail. q.v. https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=58573
